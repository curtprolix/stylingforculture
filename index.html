<h1>Styling for Culture</h1>

<div class="main_content">
<p>If the web is about anything, it is about connectivity. It allows for the connection of people and ideas across distance and time. It connects a world which contains a plurality of beliefs, opinions, cultures and assumptions. Web designers--tasked with the layout and styling of the webpages that comprise these points of connection and interaction--must maintain an awareness of the background culture, beliefs and associations which guide both their own design decisions and those of potential users outside of their own culture.</p>

<p>In researching the cultural considerations of web design, I discovered numerous academic papers, blogs, and how-to guides that discuss and advise on what I’d like to call the <em>hidden stylesheet</em>: the complex of cultural and psychosocial beliefs and expectations that operate just below the surface of our apprehension. While much too enormous a topic to give justice to here, I would instead like to describe a couple of examples that I hope will help to illuminate the assumptions behind your own styling choices and to inform your design decisions in the future.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the clearest and instructive examples is that of the difference in text direction and orientation between various cultures. As <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221513642_How_fluent_is_your_software_Designing_for_international_users">Russo & Boor</a> (1993) explain, “[…] in America a series of icons or windows will be arranged from left to right and top to bottom. Such an arrangement would be counter-intuitive to an Arabic user who reads from right to left. This would be even more confusing to a Chinese user who reads top to bottom and right to left." Knowing that the reader may have a spatial preference in where they first look at a webpage or expectations about how the content will flow would greatly affect a user’s understanding and experience of the content and thus potentially affect future use (<a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/design/cultural-factors-web-design-3135752">Creative Bloq</a>, 2013).</p> 

<p>The use of various colors and characters provides another clear example of how radically different the palate of web design can be from culture to culture and have strong effects on a user’s understanding and opinion of a website. In her paper on intercultural design techniques, <a href="http://www.psychnology.org/File/PNJ13(1)/PSYCHNOLOGY_JOURNAL_13_1_RIMONDI.pdf"> Rimondi</a> (2015) discusses an experiment where “[..] using a red ‘X’ as a prohibitive symbol in Egyptian pictures was not effective because the color red is not associated with forbiddance, and the ‘X’ is not understood as prohibitive. Similarly, Americans have virtually a perfect association for red as stop and green as go, Chinese do not.” </p>

<p>Becoming familiar with the hidden stylesheet of a culture often translates into success for your website. The company <a href="https://www.hotcourses.com/">Hotcourses</a> saw a 134% increase in their online course applications in both China and India. How? They simply changed the color of the buttons on their enrollment website to orange. The blog <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/online-brand-strategy/international-marketing/web-design-for-cultural-differences/"> Smart Insights</a> (2013) explains that orange-yellow is the holy color of wisdom in Buddhist tradition and the primary color of a knowledge festival held by the Hindus called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasant_Panchami">Vashant Panchami</a>. By implementing a single change to their CSS, the web designers were able to greatly increase revenue.<p> 

<p>Awareness of intercultural aspects of web design is a double-edged sword: not only will it enhance a designer’s ability to effectively reach users globally, but it will also foster awareness of the designer’s own culture of origin; allowing them to make full and effective use of their own cultural tropes and become better designers themselves. I hope these few examples prompt you to become familiar for the hidden stylesheet of your own culture and help you to become a better, more globally aware, web designer.</p>
